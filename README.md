# Polybar

Default launch.sh remains in the collection, and added the following: bspwm-start.sh, herbie-start.sh, and polybar-start.sh. Launches the top/main Polybar on both monitors, but no bottom/extra bar on secondary.

The weather.py script requires you to get your own location code from openweather.org.
